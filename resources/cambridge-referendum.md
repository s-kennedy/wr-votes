### What is even happening?

In addition to electing candidates, voters in Cambridge will be asked
to vote on the following referendum question: 

<p class="bigtext">"Are you in favour of the City of Cambridge using a
ranked ballot system for the 2022 municipal election?"</p>

There is more information about the referendum and
ranked ballots on the [City of Cambridge Ranked
Ballot](https://www.cambridge.ca/en/learn-about/ranked-ballot-voting.aspx)
page. 

You can find general information about municipality adoption of ranked
ballots here: Ontario Ministry of Municipal
Affairs and Housing [Ranked Ballot FAQ
page](http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page11122.aspx). 


### What is a ranked ballot? 

[Fill some pithy thing about numbering candidates here]

### What happens if the referendum passes?

If the referendum passes then the City of Cambridge will transtion to
ranked ballots for its mayoral and municipal ward positions, in time
for the 2022 election.

The referendum only applies to races for the city of Cambridge --
namely, the mayor and city councillors. All other positions (Regional
Chair, Cambridge representatives on Regional Council, and school board
trustees) will continue to be elected using the existing system. 


### What happens if the referendum does not pass?

If the referendum does not pass then the voting system in Cambridge
remains the same.  

### Under what conditions does the referendum pass?

In order for the referendum to pass, the voter turnout for the
referendum must exceed 50%, **and** a majority of those casting
ballots in the referendum
must vote yes. 

For context, in 2014 the voter turnout in Cambridge [was 29.89
percent](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/voter-turnout-in-waterloo-region-stagnant-overall-1.2815625). 
Regardless of how many voters choose to support ranked ballots in the
referendum, if the voter turnout is less than 50%, the referendum
fails.
