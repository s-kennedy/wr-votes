### What is even happening? 

The Region of Waterloo is a **two-tier** government. The upper tier is
the **Region of Waterloo**. The lower tier consists of seven
**area municipalities**: three **cities** (Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo)
and four **townships** (North Dumfries, Wellesley, Wilmot, and
Woolwich). 

The elected body that governs the upper-tier Region of Waterloo is
called **Regional Council**. Its membership consists of: 

- The **Regional Chair**
- The mayors of the seven area municipalities
- Extra **Regional Councillors** allocated to each city. Kitchener
  gets four regional councillors. Cambridge and Waterloo get two each. 


Each of the seven area municipalities has a **mayor** and a **ward
council**, consisting of **ward councillors**. The number of ward
councillors varies from municipality to municipality. 

Not including school boards, voters will be able to cast votes for the
following positions municipally: 

- regional chair.
- the mayor of their area municipality
- ward councillor(s)
- for votes within the cities, regional
  councillors 


### Is the Regional Chair like the Premier or the Prime Minister of Waterloo Region?


Unlike provincial or federal politics, the Regional Chair does not set
policy alone, and is not the leader of a party. Rather, the Regional Chair gets one vote on council
votes, just as other members of council do. 


### What do the different levels of government do?

The regional and area municipal governments each have their own
jurdisdictions, and understanding who does what can get complicated.
For example, some roads (usually major and arterial roads) are
designated as regional roads and are controlled by the Region,while
other roads are controlled by the municipality. 

On the Region of Waterloo website you can find a more detailed list of
