In the 2014 Municipal election, several Waterloo Region wards had a single candidate for city councillor. The map below shows the 2014 municipal election ward boundaries. Each ward shaded based on the number of candidates that ran for council in the 2014 election, ranging from red (a single candidate!) to various shades of green for 4 or more candidates.
