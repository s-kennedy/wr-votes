As of July 16, there are a number of potentially uncontested races in the upcoming 2018 municipal election in Waterloo Region, along with 3 wards with [no registered candidates](https://www.kitchenertoday.com/local-news/whos-running-in-your-ward-odds-are-you-have-few-voting-options-as-the-nomination-deadlines-approaches-986364). The deadline for nominations closes on July 27.
 
In the 2014 Municipal election, several Waterloo Region wards had only a single candidate for municipal councillor. The map below shows the 2014 municipal election ward boundaries. Each ward shaded based on the number of candidates that ran for council in the 2014 election, ranging from red (a single candidate!) to various shades of green for 4 or more candidates.
