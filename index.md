Municipal elections can be complicated. There are a lot of positions
to vote for! There are no political parties! How do you start
educating yourself so you can cast an informed vote?

A good start is to find out what candidates are running where you
live. 
Use the map below to locate your municipal ward, and click the
information link. 
There you will find information about candidates nominated
for different positions in your area collected on one page.

Alternatively, you can find a page for your ward in our [Ward
listing](./wards/). 

Is this entire process too confusing? Check out our resource
pages.
