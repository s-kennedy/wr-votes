<strong>About School Boards:</strong> There are four school boards in
this region. Each voter is assigned to a particular school board (by
default the Public English one) depending on how they registered to
the municipal voters list.

<strong>About Events:</strong> This page focuses on all-candidates
meetings for different races. There are other kinds of events not
listed here, such as candidate town halls, municipal information
sessions, and advance voting dates. See the Events page for a more
complete listing.
